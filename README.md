# INST-377--Final-Project
# Project Title 
Chelone

# Project Description 
Our project allows UMD students to easily create a schedule for registering for classes. Our project allows students to search for specific types of classes such as benchmark or core classes and allows them to see those speific classes that fit with their majors. This will allow students to more easioly find what classes they may need to sign up for when registering for classes.

# Target Broswer
Our main target broweser for this project is IOS. We chose this broswer because many of us in our group use Iphones so the use of targeting this specific broswer was more convenient for the group as a whole.
